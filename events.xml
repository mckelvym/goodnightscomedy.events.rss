Performing for free at comedy shows and accepting hosting gigs for very little to no money. In efforts to share his comedy with the world, he began making content and posting on social media. Buzz, traffic, and popularity all grew up and blew up. He decided, with his fiancé Ashley Cotto it was time to leave Connecticut and take the leap of faith to move to Florida. Justin continued to grind and work hard every day to become a bigger act. He wants to create people’s favorite space to laugh and is currently touring in a 2024 Worldwide Tour. He believes what you put in this game is what you get out of it. Justin will continue to put in all that he can, with great faith that he gets everything he can out of it. Creating content, performing comedy year-round while providing for his family, and keeping the faith in making a living; his 5 children are his main inspiration and drive him every day to conquer his dreams.</description>
