Known to his fans as “the feral dad of Facebook,” Graeson weaves together tales of his coupon-clipping, craft-addicted wife, his Lord-of-the-Flies children, and the wild characters of small-town America with high-energy punchlines that hit harder than sweet tea at a church picnic.His shows are a mix of gut-punching laughter, southern-fried truth bombs, and a healthy dose of 80s/90s nostalgia. From “blue-collar bougie” parenting wisdom to feral family survival tactics, Graeson McGaha delivers a night of comedy that feels like you’re hanging out on the porch with your funniest, most unfiltered friend.</description>

      <title>Room 861 at Goodnights: Steve Hofstetter &amp; Friends (August 09)</title>
      <link>https://www.goodnightscomedy.com/events/127087</link>

      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 02:03:41 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>Author, columnist, and comedian Steve Hofstetter is often called the hardest working man in show-business. With all due respect to the late James Brown. Hofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' "Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", Showtime's "White Boyz in the Hood", VH1's "Countdown", Sundance's "On the Road in America", and ABC's "Barbara Walter's Special", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of "Laughs" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally. One of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan. After hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album ("Cure For the Cable Guy") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album ("Dark Side of the Room") was the first ever pay-what-you-want" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts. Hofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook and 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores. While Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded "Sports Jerk of the Week", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid. While an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers. Without his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.</description>

      <description>Before landing the iconic role of Scarlett O'Connor on the ABC/CMT/HULU TV series NASHVILLE, and launching her career as a singer/songwriter, Clare Bowen was growing up in rural Australia. Bowen heard her first broadcast of the Grand Ole Opry on the wireless in her grandad’s kitchen and soon after, her classical vocal coach paused one of their lessons to comment on the "country lilt" that had naturally crept into Bowen's voice. It would be another decade before she'd duet with heavyweights like Zac Brown and Vince Gill, recording songs with GRAMMY-winning producers like T-Bone Burnett and Buddy Miller who became her mentors. She released an eponymous album and performed before soldout crowds in the US, UK, Germany and Australia. She also earned a coveted spot on Sugarland’s “Still The Same” tour and toured live with the Nashville cast, selling out London’s O2 Arena. Alongside the spotlight, Clare is no stranger to the darker more frightening side of the human experience. A pediatric cancer survivor, she was given just two weeks to live upon receiving a shocking cancer diagnosis at age four. With the strength of her family behind her, she survived a grueling chemotherapy regimen and is now known around the world as a beautiful ray of sunshine who leads with her heart, able to communicate and translate emotions whether on stage or on screen. Now half of the duo known as BOWEN * YOUNG, she and her husband, Brandon Robert Young are releasing music that masterfully delves into the depths of ferocious love, heartbreaking loss and steadfast hope. They have dubbed the music “Cinematic Americana”, and their debut album, “Us”, was released in May 2024 and available everywhere. Join Jonathan Jackson, musician, actor, author and filmmaker for an afternoon of live music, poetry, and stories Live on Stage at the Comedy Vault. Jonathan, best known for his role as "Lucky Spencer" on General Hospital and "Avery Barkley" on the drama series Nashville, brings his talents to the stage to engage with his fans in an intimate show with songs from Nashville, music from his new album, original poetry, and behind the scenes stories. There will also be time for a Q&amp;A session!</description>

      <description>Don “D.C.” Curry’s talents are far more than meets the eye at a single glance. At second glance you’ll see him co-starring in major studio pictures or taking on the duties of the leading man in indie feature films. Look again and you’ll see him touring the country as the lead in a hit stage play or serving as the front man of his own R&amp;B and Blues band. Take yet another glimpse (or listen) and you’ll hear him shining as a skilled voice-over artist on hit TV shows like Boondocks. Bottom line, DC Curry is a very versatile, and extremely funny man.</description>

      <description>This show is not kid-friendly and those easily offended should not attend. Topics are mostly embarrassing and school- related, but in addition, we do discuss the hilariousness of family, parenthood, dating, marriage and other life experiences on stage. Every single Teachers Gone Bad Show has been sold out or close to it! Teachers look to us to say the things on stage that they wish they could say on campus. And since some of the comedians are former teachers, they let it all out. NO HOLDING BACK! No fear of getting fired. How can you get fired if you've already been fired, right?</description>

      <description>Even before appearing on NBC'S 'Last Comic Standing', Alonzo Bodden knew there was nothing, absolutely nothing that would ever make him give up comedy. "That's the drug", he says "when they laugh it's like I'm a jazz musician and they hear it, and they get it. It's power to take the crowd wherever I want them to go. I love it when they laugh, especially when they relate through laughter. It's a beautiful thing. It also means I'm going to get paid, which is nice." Bodden didn't always make his living as a stand up comic. A graduate of Aviation High School, for 9 years he earned a paycheck as a jet mechanic for Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas. While comics around the country were making audiences laugh at airline jokes, Bodden was working on the top secret Stealth Bomber. It was during a stint as trainer that Alonzo discovered his ability to entertain a group of people. I was teaching airplane mechanics when I realized it was more fun to make them laugh, Bodden explains, I was laid off one more time and I never looked back, although it was nice to have a steady paycheck and benefits. He enrolled in a comedy class and the rest as they say, is comedy history. Alonzo has always appreciated the benefits of doing stand up comedy, one of which is having fun on stage. He recalls one of his favorite experiences, I was working at the Brea Improv and in the middle of my set, a guy had a seizure. After the paramedics carted him off, I went up there, did 10 killer minutes on seizures and then got back to my set and the show kept rolling. It was great. Bodden has ventured off the stage to have fun with his many roles on television and in film. He was the security guard, bouncer, crook, and/or a cop in 'Bringin Down the House', 'The Girl Next Door', 'Angel', and 'Grounded For Life', to name a few. Alonzo won the Season 3 grand prize on NBC's 'Last Comic Standing' after placing as runner-up on Season 2. Alonzo describes his material as cynically good natured in an angry suburban Negro kind of way. While he strongly believes that all young comics should study Bill Cosby, he freely admits that his mom is the funniest person he knows. When his family and friends attend his shows he loves and appreciates it. One of the great things about Bodden's career is that he can make you laugh and fix your Learjet. One day Alonzo hopes to have his own Learjet.</description>

      <description>Chris Higgins is a nationally touring comedian from Colorado, now based in Chicago, who brings a unique blend of stoner wisdom, masterful impressions, and outdoorsy sensibilities to stages across the country. Known for his viral stand-up clips that have amassed millions of views, his online sketch series "God n Angel" (1.6M followers), and his comedy special "Live at the Fort," Chris is quickly establishing himself as one of comedy's most distinctive rising voices. A festival favorite, Chris has performed at the New York Comedy Festival, Netflix is a Joke Comedy Festival, and High Plains Comedy Festival, while taking home "Best of the Fest" honors at both Westend Comedy Festival and 10,000 Laughs Comedy Festival. His comedy has been featured on Don't Tell Comedy, ViceTV, Bob &amp; Tom, and he's currently selling out stops nationwide. Chris's comedy attracts fans of comics like Rory Scovel, Kyle Kinane, and Mitch Hedberg - audiences who appreciate clever wordplay, unexpected perspectives, and a comedian who proves you can be both laid-back and razor-sharp. Chris combines Colorado's outdoor spirit with Chicago's comedy hustle to create something entirely his own. Chris would list more credits, but it's generally frowned upon to claim you're the host of the Tonight Show without being Jimmy Fallon.</description>

      <description>Author, columnist, and comedian Steve Hofstetter is often called the hardest working man in show-business. With all due respect to the late James Brown. Hofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' "Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", Showtime's "White Boyz in the Hood", VH1's "Countdown", Sundance's "On the Road in America", and ABC's "Barbara Walter's Special", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of "Laughs" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally. One of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan. After hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album ("Cure For the Cable Guy") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album ("Dark Side of the Room") was the first ever pay-what-you-want" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts. Hofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook and 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores. While Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded "Sports Jerk of the Week", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid. While an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers. Without his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.</description>

      <description>Big Jay Oakerson is one of the most beloved and easily recognizable comedians in New York City. His easy charm and dirty delivery endear him to audiences every night at The Comedy Cellar, The Stand and Stand Up New York. He’s no stranger to the rest of America, either, regularly headlining across the country and playing festivals including Bonaroo, Jager's Korn tour, Rock Star Energy Drink's Mayhem Fest, Gathering of the Juggalos and Funny or Die’s Oddball Festival. Jay has also recently been featured on This Is Not Happening with Ari Shaffir, Comedy Underground with Dave Attell, FX’s Louie, Inside Amy Schumer, and Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. This last year, Jay's Comedy Central hour special "Big Jay Oakerson: Live At Webster Hall" premiered. Filmed at the legendary music venue in New York City providing the perfect heavy metal vibe for the show. Jay's comedy is raw, compelling and honest to the core, as he takes viewers on a journey of brutal truths about his relationship with his teenage daughter, sexual tension between him and his best friend Dave and advise to women on how to delicately handle a man with an unfortunate penis size. His second album with Comedy Central Records, The Crowdwork Sessions: What’s Your F@#king Deal?! Recorded in 2013 live at The Stand, it captures Jay’s raunchy, off-the-cuff essence with a full hour of crowdwork. It joins Jay’s first album, An American Storyteller, a one-hour onslaught of unbridled awesomeness and raunchy rock n' roll hilarity recorded at Stand Up New York in 2009. Oakerson has hosted 2 seasons of "What's Your F@#king Deal?! Crowdwork &amp; Off The Cuff Comedy" on Seeso. Jay asks the audience to let go of pretension and leave egos at the door as he leads a pack of comics in a completely improvised show based on interactions with the crowd. The atmosphere is loose and no-holds-barred, so you'll see a side of the performers you've never seen before. He is co-host of two wildly popular podcasts - “The Most Offensive Podcast on Earth” Legion of Skanks with Luis J. Gomez and Dave Smith and The SDR (Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock &amp; Roll) Show with Ralph Sutton. He also the co-host's of The Bonfire on Comedy Central Radio Sirius XM 95 alongside Dan Soder evert Mondays through Thursday 6-8pm EST. Longtime fans of Jay’s will also remember him as Neil, the sexually ambiguous owner of a NYC rock club, on IFC’s Z-Rock, and from his appearances on Comedy Central's Premium Blend, Comedy Central Presents and Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. He’s wowed audiences at the prestigious Just For Laughs Montreal festival an impressive four times, both on The Nasty Show and with his solo show, The American Storyteller. And he’s a fan favorite guest on Sirius XM’s Bennington (previously Ron &amp; Fez).</description>
